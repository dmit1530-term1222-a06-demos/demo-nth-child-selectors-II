# Demo | Pseudo-class Nth-Child Selectors II

This demo goes over:
- nth-child, only-child, and nth-of-type selectors
- flexible layouts
- relative units

A couple of key things to remember:
- **`:nth-child`**: select elements based on their position as a child element in any parent element */select elements based on their position as a child element in any parent element.

- **`:nth-of-type`**: selects elements based on their position as a child as that type of selector.
